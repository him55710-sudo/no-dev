# Changelog

## 0.7.0 — local AI development preview (unreleased)

- Read JSON/JSONC literal facts in Korean and English without a model. Search key paths and values, jump to source, and preview/apply/undo one string, number or boolean. Preserve numeric spelling and surrounding source; block duplicate-key ranges and stale edits. Document display limits and unverified consumer behavior in [JSON data](docs/JSON_DATA.md).
- Keep browser notices in the selected language when switching Korean/English after applying or undoing a change.

- Measure a reviewed process task before and after edits: one warm-up plus seven fresh runs, elapsed time, OS peak process memory, output hashes and optional project-check evidence. Report observed variation and failures; reject stale conditions and incompatible comparisons. Local Python standard library only, with cancellation and per-run limits. See [measurement scope](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).

- Add optional Ollama explanations and multiple exact-range edits in desktop VS Code. Require cloud-disabled loopback service and installed local text models; no paid API or API key fallback.
- Ground citations and edits in unique original source ranges, require changed-source evidence, bound requests, and cancel stale work. Review the native diff and unchecked behavior before explicit apply; use normal editor undo.
- Check proposed JS/TS/JSX/TSX and JSON syntax; parse Python with an isolated local interpreter without executing user code. Other language checks remain unavailable.
- Publish the implementation plan, agent work log, actual Python/model/editor evidence and a failed optimization: itsdangerous tests passed before and after, but the proposed function was slower and was not adopted.
- Add explicitly reviewed project test/build commands through VS Code tasks, with saved-file checks, real exit codes, cancellation and stale-result notices. Validate itsdangerous tests passing, a known regression failing and undo restoring 297 passing tests. See [project checks](docs/PROJECT_CHECKS.md).
- Preserve TSX/JSX source extensions in native rule diffs instead of labeling every preview as TypeScript.
- This is not verified support for every language or automatic optimization. See [local AI setup and limitations](docs/LOCAL_AI.md).
- Add JSONC structure and proposal syntax checks with comments/trailing commas, preserving strict JSON rules. Validate the packaged worker outside project dependencies and isolate each VS Code test profile.
- Publish 28 actual local-model responses across 14 language identifiers with semantic errors and rejected edits included. Choose model context size from bounded request size; do not claim universal quality or measured speedups.

## 0.6.0 — understand the editor's reports

- Connect current-file VS Code diagnostics to a compact summary and the Review view, with provider, severity, original message and exact source navigation.
- Explain four common TypeScript errors in Korean and English while preserving original messages and leaving unknown reports untranslated.
- Distinguish edited reports, reject stale report/file navigation, show empty reports without a pass claim and cap long lists/messages with visible omissions.
- Add a typed shipping example and real TypeScript integration coverage: apply an invalid literal value, inspect error 2322, navigate and undo.
- These are existing editor reports, not a new full-project type checker or pre-apply semantic verification. No scripts, provider commands or automatic fixes are run.

## 0.5.2 — explain cleanup in the correct order

- Keep `finally` separate from the try body and display it after catch in both the story and Markdown export.
- Explain pending returns through enclosing finalizers, keep nested function boundaries intact, and stop describing catch behavior when there is no catch.
- Bound else and finalizer rendering at the same depth as ordinary child steps.
- Add a realistic async save example, semantic/renderer regressions and a VS Code worker/source-link integration check. The restricted simulator does not gain async or try/catch execution support.

## 0.5.1 — from the demo to your own code

- Add shared installation and feedback help to the browser and VS Code panel, plus a next-step card after a browser demo edit.
- Prepare and copy a user-reviewed experience summary locally. Do not attach source/paths, place feedback in URLs, send telemetry or create issues automatically. Link to a bilingual GitHub experience form.
- Keep successful, stuck and unsupported experiences distinct. Add an empty observation sheet and first-use study protocol; no user results are claimed.
- Scope sidebar navigation styles and keep mobile install/export actions reachable.

## 0.5.0 — read the interface, change its words

- Read JSX/TSX elements, component props, text, conditional branches and simple map callbacks as an expandable, source-linked structure in VS Code and the browser.
- Edit static JSX text and quoted attributes with compiler-correct whitespace/entity decoding and inert string-expression replacements. Re-editing and native undo work through the existing checked patch path.
- Distinguish render-time calls from passed event functions. Display spread/complex expressions and truncation limits explicitly. React components are excluded from the calculation simulator.
- Add a React membership-card example, VS Code command, direct browser demo link and multiline text inputs.
- Add 14 core checks and a real TSX editor integration flow. Browser demo history now accurately explains that changes are not saved.

## 0.4.0 — your project's words

- Add Korean/English names for source declarations in the browser and VS Code, without renaming source identifiers.
- Bind terms to lexical symbols so shadowed names keep their own meaning; use custom names in stories, function inputs, rule tables and sentence edits.
- Persist terms per browser workspace or VS Code document URI; isolate demo mode and untitled documents.
- Invalidate pending changes when terminology changes and retain cache entries for unaffected files.
- Cover name binding, sentence edits, reset, input limits and file-switch behavior. Restrict unit-test discovery to the maintained source tests.

## 0.3.0 — open-source preview

- Compare up to 12 input scenarios against the actual pending change in the browser and VS Code.
- Editable input tables and suggested numeric boundary cases; unsupported results remain unavailable.
- Export a bilingual Markdown comparison report without automatic uploads.
- Isolated browser demo mode, a direct first-change walkthrough, and relative assets for static hosting.
- MIT repository license, contributor and security guidance, issue templates and CI definitions.
- Versioned VSIX, source and offline-demo packaging with SHA-256 checksums.

This is a preview, not a production assurance tool. User demand, comprehension gains and retention have not yet been measured.

## 0.2.0 — VS Code prototype

Native editor explanations, source navigation, diff, buffer edits and undo; document version checks and workspace import graph.

## 0.1.0 — browser prototype

Korean/English stories, rules, dependency map, local file import, constrained patches and a restricted AST interpreter.
